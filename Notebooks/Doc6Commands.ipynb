    "We've seen the simpler building blocks of command-based programming in the previous document--how we can get inputs and group devices into subsystems--as well as how projects are generally organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll take a close look at the thing that gives `Command-Based Programming` its name: Commands, as well as some of the features which tie very closely into the command-based framework, and BooleanEvents/Triggers. This section will begin, however, with a discussion about a concept with many names, such as `lambdas`, `closures`, `anonymous-functions`. They present an alternative method for the representation of actions in our projects and are crucial towards the new kind of command-based programming that is being pushed by the designers of WPILib.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it will be worthwhile to look at them in great (albeit tangentially related) detail, and to really understand their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you go through this first section, it is recommended to give everything here a try yourself in JShell. Try replicating the results from the codeblocks and see what results, play around with creating and applying them and see if their behavior matches your expections. If not, try and figure out why, and don't hesistate to ask if something is especially confusing. Lambdas, and their related features are famously a source of confusions for many java programmers. "

    "## Triggers : An Addendum \n",
    "With the introduction of Commands, it is also useful to look at an additional construction that we can use to associate commands with events in the same way BooleanEvents work with actions. Here WPILib provides us with the `Trigger` class, which mirrors the `BooleanEvent` class in many ways, but instead of taking in an action as a `Runnable` function, it takes in a `Command` instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact set of functionality provided by Triggers can be found in its [javadoc](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj2/command/button/Trigger.html). Some of the method names change between the two classes (such as onFalse and onTrue instead of falling and rising). Also since Commands are more versatile than actions used in BooleanEvents, `Trigger` has some methods which do not have parallels in `BooleanEvent`, such as the while methods and the toggle methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers also allow us to directly link controller inputs to their associated functions, and as a result, (with the exception of default events) much of the scheduling of commands during the teleop phase can be done with Triggers instead of being done manually: E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// in RobotContainer\n",
    "var intake = new Intake(); // subsystem\n",
    "var in = /* get button input (next section) */;\n",
    "var out = /* get button input (next section) */;\n",
    "in.whileTrue(intake.suckCommand(1));\n",
    "out.whileTrue(intake.suckCommand(-1));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, when they are manually created, Triggers have the option of either being bound to an EventLoop like BooleanEvents, or to the CommandScheduler, based on whether they recieve an EventLoop or not in the constructor. Examples on how Triggers can be used in conjunction with commands can be found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/binding-commands-to-triggers.html). "

    "### Getting Trigger Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers, by their design, are very suited for usage with user inputs. As such, the WPILib library provides a collection of methods for creating Triggers from inputs, and our own `UserDigital` interface has a helper method for creating a Trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From UserDigital\n",
    "\n",
    "The UserDigital interface has a default method `asTrigger` which creates a Trigger from the UserDigital object. \n",
    "```java\n",
    "UserDigital in = () -> true;\n",
    "var trigger = in.asTrigger();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: UserDigital also has a asBooleanEvent method which creates a BooleanEvent from the UserDigital object when provided with an EventLoop argument. There is currently no method to create a trigger with an EventLoop from a UserDigital.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Digital Inputs More Generally\n",
    "\n",
    "The command-based input classes, such as `CommandXboxController` or `CommandGenericHID` for general inputs have methods for their digital (button) inputs that create Triggers from them. As an example, to create a Trigger from the `A` button of an `XboxController`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.CommandXboxController;\n",
    "var controller = new CommandXboxController(0); //input being the port on driver station\n",
    "var trigger = controller.a(); // an eventLoop can also be provided\n",
    "```\n"
